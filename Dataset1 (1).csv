B0006O90Z6,1/16 31 Ford Van,A2LKCLM8ZX267X,0/0,5,1361836800,"Recently bought this kit and began construction.The parts are well made but there was a tiny bit of flashing on one part - no problem though.The Engine is extremely detailed ,even has a dipstick.The rest of the kit so far is quite easy to build ,the engine being the most detailed part.All doors open and the chassis can be made to roll freely.The only thing i did not like about it's design was that the kit option on the fender where the spare tire sits ,you get two left front fenders and when you begin to fit it it is a little tricky and seems odd.you can go online and get the full assembly instructions from the minicraft website - there you can see the kit trees and how the kit will assemble , so that will give you a good idea about the product beforehand.Also , after i bought this kit i went online and found several others and some were priced as high as $150.00 ,so being a discontinued kit from the 1990's may make it a bit rare , not sure. I would definitely recommend this kit for a moderately experienced builder , but not for someone just beginning model crafting , as I think the smaller and more delicate pieces would just cause frustration.",toys games,hobbies,model building kits tools
B000NJN25S,1/24 RC 3-Ch Remote Control M1A2 Abrams Tank,A1G4XMOEBFOL3Q,0/0,2,1356652800,"I bought this primarily for indoor play. Turns out it's not really suitable for it - at least not in my house. The instructions warn against using it on carpet! We still checked it out, to try and decide if we wanted a similar toy that worked on carpet, or one of the alternatives. For that little bit, it worked ok. No problems with tread loss that others reported. The BB gun loaded and fired as per the instructions. There were some reception problems, but it's not clear if that was range or interference from a nearby computer. If it was a radio range, it was maybe 15 feet, which would be a serious issue outdoors.The things that set this one apart from the others we had considered were all disappointments. The choice came down to one of the BB-firing tanks with an canon that could be elevated, or an IR canon with a life counter of some kind suitable for simulating battles. The BB gun fires at sufficient velocity that tracking shots inside is nearly impossible, so we're not going to look for another of those. The gun elevation isn't really controllable. There's one button that elevates it to the top of the (rather limited) range, then lowers it to the bottom, then back up, and so on, instead of one button for up and one for down. Sort of pointless, and not at all fun. The demo mode is mildly amusing, but hitting the button by accident while trying to go forward happened sufficiently often that leaving off the demo feature would have been an improvement.Driving the tank itself was also a bit of a loss. While the motors driving the treads have two speeds in both directions, you can't really use all the possibilities. Turning is limited to one tread going while the other is still (basically pivoting around the still tread) or having them go in opposite directions (spinning in place). While having two rates of spin seems a little pointless, having the ability to shift one tread into high gear while the other stays at normal speed - resulting in a turn while moving forward - would have been a major improvement in the toy.The programming aspect looked like it might be fun, but that was a bust as well. It doesn't move while recording a program, so you can't tell what it's doing. When you record a move, pressing a button triggers the selected action for a preset amount of time, which you can't change by, for instance, holding down the button. The turns come out at almost 180 degrees. You can't even replicate the demo mode programs with it.I seriously considered giving this tank one star, but it wasn't broken or completely useless out of the box - just where I wanted to use it. So it gets two stars, with a warning about not using it in most houses.",toys games,hobbies,radio control

It's all in one box. By that measure, this is an excellent value, and a great way to pass the time with family play.The problem is that you get what you pay for. This isn't solid wood. It's particle board with a cheap veneer. The game set arrived in a cardboard box surrounded with bubble pack cushions inside a larger box. No signs of damage on any of the packaging. Yet when we opened it up, we found that the game set was already in need of repair.The game boards you see pictured sliding out of the box are actually held up by small wooden shelves. Those shelves are glued to the inside of the box. There's no groove for them, no dovetailing, no screws or fasteners. Just a flat piece of particle board glued to another flat piece of particle board. And when the game set arrived, two of those shelves had already fallen off and needed to be glued back on. One corner of the Chinese Checkers tray needed to be glued back together, too.Treat it gently and keep a bottle of glue handy, and you'll have hours of family fun, with variety at your fingertips.",toys games,games,game collections

B0006ULI2S,3M STERI-STRIP Skin Closure - 1/2 x 4 - Envelope,A13ID9WFEHVS0K,0/0,5,1354665600,"I fell into the corner of a wall while sleepwalking (I know, I know, how ridiculous) and managed to split open my chin. I had to get 8 stitches, and I had a huge gross stitched line on my chin, which is hardly the new accessory I wanted for my work look. I tried bandaids, but the face is an oily place, and they would just peel off all the time, especially with the location on my chin moving the bandage so much when I talked. Also, regular bandaids just look gross right on your face like that. Ugh. But then, I went to the doctor to get the stitches removed, and she used these steri-strips to hold the wound shut (they take out face stitches way earlier than full healing, because you don't want to heal around the stitches and end up with a huge and raised scar).Anyway, these steri-strips were BEYOND FANTASTIC for covering the wound/scar as it was healing; I kept it covered at all times because of hygienic reasons since the cut was so close to my mouth, and at night as well because it itched and the steri-strip protected it from me unconsciously scratching it.I love these so much.Then a coworker was getting moles removed, so I gave her the extra package of these I had bought, and she loved them too. If the wound is still open or sore, these will stick a bit, so just use a little neosporin so it won't stick. Otherwise though, these STAY PUT, which is really helpful.Oh, in my experience, be sure to change these every day. They'll feel like they could stick forever, and once the wound had healed into a scar, I was tempted to leave these for longer than a day, and they'll easily last for that, but when left on longer than about a day, the adhesive gets kind of gummy sticky, which isn't pleasant.Overall, I love these...but I'm thrilled I don't have to wear them anymore!",health personal care,health care,first aid

The only thing i don't like is that the hole for each place to put the letter is not very deep-the letter stays in nicely but for a two year old playing with it, i can see that the letters will fall out and potentially will get lost, if he carries the puzzle to another area in the room. My parents have a puzzle from the 80's where the area for each letter is deeper so the pieces don't come out as easily. but i am overall very happy with my purchase. the colors are very vibrant, the actual puzzle itself is made very well. I just wish that where you put each letter could be somewhat deeper. the letters do stay put even when the puzzle is standing upright so don't get me wrong, it's not like the puzzle is poorly made- the pieces do stay there. it's more of a personal preference. great puzzle! :)",toys games,puzzles,jigsaw puzzles

B000CELAN0,Alex fashion weave loom with fluffy yarn ages 7+,A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ,03-Mar,4,1349740800,The brand of the weave loom I purchase is different but the contents is exactly the same. Rainbow color yarn balls and the wooden loom. I purchase it bcuz I am always looking to expand my crafting skills and enjoy trying new things. With winter around the corner I wanted to learn different ways of making a scarf for Christmas gifting besides knitting and crochet. So I bought this wooden loom. I must admit it's a bit pricey but sorta worth it. The instructions aren't very detailed but YouTube has loom weaving vids that help make instructions alot more clearer to understand. I had to knock one star off bcuz of that and the fact that the box states 75 yards of yarn but really it's only good for making one scarf. Good thing I have a large stock of yarn and also it's kinda difficult to make a scarf bcuz the length of your woven item is short so the way you make a scarf is to weave up to the top of the loom then sew several pieces together to make it into a scarf length. It's really tedious and this loom is probably best only to make potholders or small pouches but not scarves or anything of that sort. Overall I think it's an okay gift to purchase but keep in mind if the gift receiver doesn't have much patience or unable to sit for long periods this may not be the best gift as it's very time consuming and requires lots of patience sitting on your caboose.*EDIT,toys games,arts crafts,craft kits

The only other cleaner I use is some diluted Murphy's Oil Soap for wood and Lysol Spray for raw meat spillage (because I don't want to take risks with that). Otherwise, it's BioKleen All Purpose all the way!!I have 2 All Purpose spray bottles purchased years ago and now I just dilute the concentrate and refill the bottles as needed. One for the kitchen, one for the bathrooms. I love it so much that I've since expanded into laundry products, fabric refresher, dishwashing supplies, drain cleaner, etc. We cloth diaper and have 2 large dogs and the Bac-Out in particular has been a lifesaver. Everything has a light, clean, NATURAL smell... so when you're cleaning, you get the feeling you're hanging out in an orange grove instead of a chemical plant. My favorite is the Lemon Thyme fabric refresher. Amazing!!The only thing I've found that I don't like is the Produce Wash, and that's only because we despise the smell of licorice.I do wish they would create a line of biodegradable, disposable wipes for on-the-go, like diaper bags or for quick clean ups around the house.

The ingredients in Almased are basic which is what I like. The texture is a little coarser than other shakes I have tried, but this one keeps me satisfied much longer without making my blood sugar go through the roof. In my opinion I think the trade off is fair. I do dress it up a little though. I either add stevia and a table spoon of regular unsweetened cocoa powder, or sugar free hazelnut espresso syrup with a table spoon of dark unsweetened cocoa powder. Without any dressing up, the taste and texture remind me of a cross between muffin batter and cake batter. There are no artificial flavors but it has a creamy flavor, probably from the honey. I prefer to mix it with ice in the blender. If you make it with coffee and chocolate for a mocha flavor the coffee has to be at least room temperature or colder to avoid killing the probiotics. There are a few other recipes I want to try as well, just haven't gotten around to it yet.I haven't used it long term for weight loss, but have used it to recover from overdone splurges or when I'm just looking for a very light meal. If I splurge and put on a couple pounds I can usually recover and lose them again after doing my shakes for a couple days.Pros:Basic ingredientsLow glycemic impactSatisfying and stays with youGreat for getting in extra protein or for managing weightCons:The texture is a little coarser than most other shakes, but that is because it is minimally processed (in comparison to other mixes)The price is a bit high but this seller is lower than what I can get it locally forShipping was fast and arrived just as promised.

I was pretty confused at first because I never though aloe would do anything for acne, but the next day my acne was sooooo much better! I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.) but nothing has worked even close to as well as this does! Plus it doesn't burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin. Now I rarely ever get acne! I've also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin). Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands.

I use it as a face moisturizer after showering. I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly. A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers. I know this because I've reapplied every couple hours on a healing area from removing a mole and this is when you experience flaking... not from one layer of covering your face. It really makes my face feel healthy and tight. It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it. I'm anxious to see what becomes of the area where the dermatologist sliced me but it's too soon right now to say.

After a long day, lying in bed at night used to be very painful, taking at least an hour for my body to &#34; settle&#34; so that I could even try to relax over the pain, especially in my feet. It now takes about five to ten minutes to &#34;settle&#34;. One great benefit is that my spider veins on my legs are disappearing. That's such a confidence booster, for older women in particular. I really don't like to go to the doctor, but the last time I was there they said my chlorestoral was up. I think that the black seed oil will prove to be working on that as well. And one last thing, the extra weight around my middle has been reduced, and I have only started taking black seed oil about three and a half weeks ago. I feel very happy and excited to have found something that works for me on SO many levels. The down side is that I can only find this online right now.

Since it doesn't say what kind of sugar, we must presume it's white, refined sugar. There may be as much as 530mg of Vit C in each tablet, but apparently only about 30mg of that is from natural sources.

I thought that maybe I needed more to get closer to the color on the sticker that is on the cap. So, I added some more. Still too pink. So I added still more. By the time I had finished, it was slightly more brown, but still had way too much of a pink undertone for what I was looking for. And it really wasn't close to the colored sticker on the bottle.I'm pretty disappointed. Perhaps it is just this brown color that is the problem and that the others are great.

If you fully coat your hair, the product will run, so you're going to want to wrap your neck in a towel. Try to wrap your hair or have it up, without something holding it up. You could sit for 40 min & let this stuff air dry, but when using this product, I just blow dry my hair on a medium setting. As your hair begins to dry, it will still look wet, but it will become very hard. Be careful not to agitate your hair or try to comb through it, or you'll risk breakage. After your hair is dry, simply hop back in the shower, gently wash the treatment out & apply a deep conditioner -- then you're done!",beauty,hair care,hair scalp treatments

The filter is super silent and the pressure of the water coming out of can be turned up for even more cleaning power or tuned down for silence while you sleep. Hand down best turtle filter I have ever owned. There is not one speck of algae, food, or poop on the floor. Totally worth the money. This has made owning a turtle the easiest task on the planet.

So, I returned it for a replacement, and received another defective impeller (no blades cracked off, but it had come loose from the plastic box during shipping and bounced around, causing wear and tear, and when placed in my filter, was exponentially louder than it had ever been) due to improper packaging. So, I returned THAT one for a replacement, and the third impeller had one blade cracked off. It's not worth it to keep asking for replacements if they won't improve the packaging. These impellers are delicate and the littlest chip will cause the impeller to rattle in the filter. That said, I do not recommend buying this impeller online.

Then I found it on Amazon and was shocked at how much cheaper it was. I purchased it, and the shipping was fast and the packaging was secure. However, I am pretty sure this is the old version of the product.For one thing, the smell is very, very faint. It smells nice, but I can hardly smell it right after spraying, and I can't smell it at all after the first minute. I thought maybe my nose was just not working, so I asked several friends and family if they could smell it, and they said they couldn't smell it either. Even when I used a ton of sprays and even resorted to spraying it on my clothes, it simply didn't last. The one I tried out in Sephora was strong and lasted quite a while.The scent issue wouldn't have been so bad if this stuff actually did anything for my hair as it claims it does, but it doesn't do anything. It didn't tame my fly aways or frizz or make it look shiny.I don't like leaving negative feedback and I definitely don't like accusing people easily, so I don't make this claim lightly.

I used the entire package in one treatment and nothing happened. If you have a swimming pool then you know how irritating and expensive it is to constantly treat the horrible brown stains that appear on the underwater surfaces. The only effective thing I have found is a combination of Iron Out and Iron Myte. The trouble is, if you then fail to replace the water, or at least half of it, with iron-free water, the stains come right back within 24 hours. Although effective, each treatment with those products was costing me $30 each time, essentially every other day, until I was able to obtain iron-free water to drain and refill the pool. By the way, Iron Myte is much cheaper at Menards compared to Am......on. About 1/2 the price regularily. Also, I know that Iron Out is not recommended for swimming pools because it's an irritant. So use it sparingly , like inside a white athletic sock like an eraser, and don't use the pool for several hours.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements

With her I had to sit down next to it and play with the water until she decided it was safe because I am still alive. She started drinking from it and has abandoned her favorite water hole (the toilet) because this one has fresh running water. The other water dish we had out for her and changed on a regular basis did not provide cool water and was not appetizing.The youngest (3 months old) had an ""I will try to touch it and see if it bites"" approach. From 3 feet away her paw slowly reached out to tap it. Scoot closer... Reach... Scoot... run into the other room. she watched it for about 20 minutes when the older came up and drank from it. OMG what is this. Now she too has no problem drinking from the cooler.At first it was entertaining to watch them drink from it. Now it is just plain convienient. They get fresh water all the time, and I do not have to replace water 5 times a day.4 Stars for the value on this one. -1 star because of it's noise level is kinda high in the evening when nothing is going on.I would advise other cat owners to pick this up.

It does appear just a little of this will go a long way, which makes it a cost-effective product. I did test a small area on some (vintage) mustard-colored cookware, but quickly stopped as it appeared to be causing some surface damage (slightly removing the finish).

Scruff arrived and the little one was THRILLED! He took to him immediately and they are now the best of friends. The fabric is wonderfully soft and cuddly. Unfortunately, after just one day with him at daycare, Scruff came home with a huge hole in the seam on the back. Luckily, our son hadn't noticed, and Scruff still had all of his stuffing and beads. I was able to ""operate"" and sew him back up to be used. However, I'm very disappointed that after just one day of use (and not rough use), Scruff needed repairs. My four-year-old's dog was mine when I was young and has never needed fixing. As long as you can sew any busted seams, it's a worthwhile purchase.

I use the conditioner daily and I feel that it has helped not only with strenth of my hair but also adds to the control I am actually using less product now in my hair because my hair will stay put and I am no longer trying to keep it tame on windy days. Not really any drawbacks on either right now and if you are thining a little or want to boost your hairs strength I would say give it shot.

In fact, mad enough that I' writing to Aveeno to ask then to please bring this back. I hope you all will join me in this.This is what I sent to Aveeno:""I've used Aveeno Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion since it was first put on store shelves. Now I cannot find it ANYWHERE. From what I have heard, you've discontinued the product. If this is true, I (and MANY OTHERS) would like you to please re-consider this action. If you will not be producing the Postively Smooth Lotion, I will no longer bother purchasing any Aveeno products at all. Positively Smooth Body Wash and Shave Gel are still available, but they are not as good, and I have no interest in them.

NO MORE AVEENO, PERIOD.I'd like to recommend switching to Veet or Nair Cream Hair Removers. In the past, cream depilatories were something I could NOT use. They smell horrid, did not do a very good job with hair removal, and ALWAYS left a chemical burn on my skin even though I removed it right away.Today's formulations are much different. They still stink like hell, but they effectively remove all unwanted hair, and leave skin smooth and soft for about 2 weeks. They come with a sponge to smooth the cream on. I leave it on for the shortest duration noted in the instructions, and then rinse off with a gentle Buff Puff Sponge thoroughly in the shower. Hope this helps some of you. If you're skin is highly sensitive, you may want to avoid the Buff Puff method, or avoid cream depilatories completely.

I used it everyday and brought it with me wherever my little boy and I went. I loved how i could hold my baby safely by my chest while having my arms free to do things. Another plus was that I could comfortably breastfeed him and no one could tell what I was doing. Great product!=)",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers
B000UYC9SW,Baby K'tan Baby Carrier,ATU54FU1VI1SG,03-Mar,5,1345939200,"I'm on baby #2 and bought this sling the very day she was born. I must say I love this product and use it multiple times a day. As a mother of an active 2 year old, I have to always have my hands free. I also have the Moby Wrap and Baby Bjorn from my first, but so far, I prefer the Baby Ktan.Pros:1) SO easy to put on. Put it around your neck while holding baby. With one arm holding baby, slip one arm through a loop, move the baby to that arm, slip the opposite arm in the other loop. The Ktan NEVER touches the ground and your baby is always in your arms to avert the hold-me-cries which is the reason you need the sling in the first place. The Moby wrap is SO cumbersome to put on, it's not worth it to take out of the house. You definitely need two hands to tie the darn thing in place and the vast length of material inevitably touches the ground, which can be gross if you are at a restaurant or public place. Baby Bjorn is easier to put on than the Moby, but still more difficult than the Ktan. Since there are buckles, usually someone else has to be holding baby to put on.2) Relatively easy to get baby in. This takes some practice. The Ktan and Moby are similar in this regard, but I don't use the extra midsection piece for security since I'm not doing major lifting. I find that if you spread the fabric of each loop out to cover the baby twice, the extra midsection piece is not necessary. Right now my daughter is only 7 weeks old and I pretty much use the Ktan to get her off to sleep or go for walks. If I ever attempt to do more strenuous activity (housecleaning, tackle football), then I'll definitely consider taking the time to place the extra piece.3) Easy to get baby out without waking her. Since I don't use the midsection piece, I simply peel each loop off her back and butt, lean over the crib, and slide her onto the bed. I find that the lifting motion required to get baby out of the Baby Bjorn usually wakes them up.4) Easy to wear when not in use. I don't find the sling particularly fashionable, but if you are in a situation requiring baby to go in and out frequently, it's nice that it is lightweight and stays out of your way so you can drive and walk with ease. I've never left the Baby Bjorn on sans baby, but I imagine its stiffness does not lend to convenient driving.5) Easy to pack. The Moby is huge and difficult to pack, as is the Baby Bjorn. I can throw my Baby Ktan in my diaper bag or purse and have room for other items.6) Saves me the hassle of getting a double stroller - so far. I just pop my toddler in his single stroller like I normally would, throw the little one in the sling and get going. I know this is short-lived while she is still so tiny.Cons:1) The small ring that holds the loops together serves to tighten the wrap once baby is in place. This can be difficult to reach if too high up. Putting on the sling so this ring is within reach takes a little practice, unless you are a body contortionist.2) One size does not fit all. I'm 5'3"" and 140lb (hopefully 15 pounds lighter in the near future!) and wear the size small. My husband is 6'3"" and probably would not be able to fit the sling. This does not pose a problem for us as he would ""never be caught dead wearing a baby in a sling."" But definitely a consideration if your husband would.3) Price. At $10 more than the Moby Wrap, I had to seriously consider whether buying this sling was necessary when I already had the Moby. It's just a few pieces of fabric! Why so expensive? But since I figured I would never have the time to tie the Moby wrap while chasing around my 2 year old, it was worth the money.4) Nursing baby in sling is difficult for me. So far, I haven't had much luck using this to nurse. Maybe it's because I'm on #2 and have much fewer qualms about just whipping it out in public.So after 7 weeks, I'm still loving this product better than the Moby and Bjorn. We'll see if it stands the test of time.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers

We sent them a screenshot proving to them that what we ordered on our registry was the original, so they agreed to refund the person who purchased it for us the money, but said that we have to pay shipping. That seemed ridiculous, since it is their fault for advertising that they're selling the original but sending out the crappy deluxe.

Baby hit the ground sleeping and thank God nothing happened to the baby (she remained asleep). This is NOT for newborns who are still tiny (mine is 7lbs 3 oz at discharge from the hospital). I strongly suggest you don't use this product while running around the house even for a sec. Good for sitting in a sofa doing computer work, as I have done so. But the moment you start walking, a tiny baby will fall through the cracks and hit the floor. It happened almost the second time again today.

I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled.

She loves to look through every page over and over and studies the pictures and brings the book back over and over.

In order to confirm my suspicions, I went and retrieved an old container which I purchased from Sephora, so I knew it was legit. Sure enough the imitation was the same in appearance, but the major difference was that the fact that there was no batch # on the imitation (There was one on the good container) and the font on the bottom label is different.Buyers Beware as there is no telling how this makeup is composed and that in itself is scary!",beauty,makeup,face

It will fill w/ water after you quit squeezing it. Then just put the open end of the tube into/over this piece on Joker's back. Then when you squeeze the bellow again, water shoots out of his Orchid on his jacket! His legs can move & his knees bend. His arms move, but don't bend @ the elbows. His head can move left to right.

I got it with my first child three years ago. I now have my second child and love the peace of mind it brings us. Both of my boys were belly sleepers. This monitor would allow me to put them in their crib on their bellies without worrying about burying their faces. Yesterday morning the alarm went off. Before I got in the room the alarm turned off. I checked the baby (11 weeks old) and he was breathing and he his head was turned to the side so I could see he had plenty of air. The only thing I can think that happened was he stopped breathing long enough to trigger the alarm and the beeping was enough to startle him to start breathing again. This monitor is worth the price for any parent. Even when the baby wiggles his way up to the top of the crib, the monitor can still pick up his light breathing.I wouldn't plan on it being your only type of monitor. The parent units get too much static. We quickly stopped using those with my first child and only turn on the base when the baby is in his crib. Also, it doesn't work well if you have an incline in the crib. When our first child began to sleep in his crib we had him on an incline. The monitor couldn't pick up his light breathing with both the matress and his incline and would falsely go off.I also have a video monitor that i can view on my phone.

B0005Z7YIG,"Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup Mix, 9 Oz.,",A27B1QDN3K2AF1,0/0,5,1358899200,"Here's my personal recipe I've used for the past 14 or so years whenever I make this. I find it's WAY WAY better than following the label.You need:One 9 oz. package Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup MixOne 14 - 15 oz can diced tomatoesOne 14 - 15 oz can tomato sauceTwo 8 oz packages fresh sliced triple washed button mushroomsDisregard the instructions on the soup package. :)Open the can of tomatoes and pour them into a strainer. Use a spoon to scrape the strainer to help drain excess liquid off. Canned diced tomatoes come in many different types and seasonings. I recommend just plain Hunts or Del Monte diced tomatoes.Put 8 cups of your favorite spring water in a 4 quart pot. Salt and pepper the water, and add any other of your favorite seasoning (I use hot pepper flakes).Bring the water to a boil, then add the strained tomatoes, tomato sauce (I use Contadina), and both packages of fresh sliced mushrooms. (It will look like it's overloaded with mushrooms, but they will GREATLY reduce in size by the time cooking is done.) Start a kitchen timer for 20 minutes. Cover, wait until boiling starts again, then reduce heat to medium and partially uncover the lid so that you get a constant light rolling boil. Wait for the 20 minutes to expire.Now add the soup mix. Start another 20 minute timer. Stir until boiling starts up again, then again partially uncover until you have a constant light rolling boil, and wait for the second 20 minutes to expire.Turn off the heat, and transfer to an appropriate 10-12 cup heat resistant container.Cover the container and place in the refrigerator. You *can* eat it right away if you want, but after waiting a day, the mushrooms, tomatoes, and all of the ingredients from the soup mix will fully ""plump,"" marinate, and absorb the flavor. You can then reheat it and have the tastiest tomato-mushroom-barley stew ever!This same recipe / procedure also works very well with Bear Creek's Minestrone soup mix.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food

Changed from 4 stars to 3 stars after using it for a while.This review is for the 12"" BED WEDGE Pillow by DMI (Duro-Med Industries), distributed by Briggs Medical. I've posted photos with additional details.I purchased this pillow for my husband's regular use and my occasional use. My husband uses it for two reasons:1. To reduce congestion my husband experiences in his nose, throat, and chest during sleep.2. To be able to see the television better while lying in bed.It allows you to elivate your head so you can see the television while lying in bed (we still have to add one or two regular bed pillows for comfort), which is better than piling up 4 or 5 pillows as we've done for years. And (more importantly) my husband's sinuses don't drain into the back of his throat and make him choke & gurgle and snore while sleeping. But we have a few other comments.THIS IS AN ADDED COMMENT, ENTERED ON 11-16-12, AFTER I FIRST CREATED THIS REVIEW ON 10-20-12:At first my husband told me he was very happy with this pillow, after he used it for a few days, but now that he's had it for about 4 weeks he rarely uses it. He now says it makes him feel like he's sliding down onto his elbows and it puts pressure on his elbows and butt. Another reviewer said the same thing. I honestly really do not understand how this could be, because he has been piling up pillows to produce the same reclining position for years. The only thing I can think is that the firmness of the pillow is the problem - instead of your body sinking in and getting comfortable, you slide down it like a, well, like a slide, because it's so firm. This is why I changed the star rating today from 4 to 3, because my husband now doesn't like to use it to sleep. He only uses it once in a while to watch TV while lying down. Not worth the money I spent. I think they really need to make these pillows softer. All of the other information in my review, below, still stands as true.OKAY, BUT COULD USE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS:My husband and I both feel this pillow is a bit too firm, but we also realize if it were softer then it wouldn't do as good a job of lifting his head - his head and shoulders would instead sink down. So, we feel the firmness is needed, just not as firm as it is now. To make it more comfortable against his body he places a layer of soft pillows on top of the wedge.

After their early death in the movie, they have to stay in their house for a certain amount of time before they can 'move on' but things go horribly wrong when a modern, city couple and their moody daughter move in.Without spoiling too much, I'll let you know that Beetlejuice still holds up very well today. The story is fun, the effects are a little cheesy but not horrible, and the comedy is almost nonstop. I gave it 4 stars due to the lightning of the film being poor in some areas.

Beetlejuice is brightly colored early gem in that collection that has been bit forgotten behind darker, later masterpieces. The story itself is however very &#34;Burtonesque&#34; and feels to be close relative of Edward Scissorhands that has similarly abstract, colorful imagery and bit sad undertones behind otherwise brightly colored fantasy world.Here we have Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as newly-deceased lovely, naive couple who want to get rid of family that has settled in their old house - and their desperate attempts lead them to bio-exorcist Betelgeuze, who of course almost manages to wreck everything before bright, happy ending. The whole cast from happy couple to Michael Keaton's demented Betelgeuze to Winona Ryder's goth girl and annoyingly preppy Catherine O'hara seem bit unlikely selections in their roles but that makes them even more charming and fun. And the score of Danny Elfman fits the picture well together with sunny tunes of Harry Belafonte.It is rumoured that there will be sequel for Beetlejuice but I am not sure whether that is a good idea... maybe he should be left to wait in Underworld with his shrunken head and hope that nobody calls his name three times...",grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices

It's not in order, in my non-professional opinion I would have much rather seen the organs at the bottom, then skeleton, muscles, exc..... So I would be able to better explain to her that her ribs are over her heart and lungs to protect them and her skull is there to protect her brain. But ehh...It is a good size. It's tall and slender the pieces are also a good size so if one is dropped it is findable.So in conclusion if you are looking for a puzzle that is educational themed this is a good buy, if you are looking for something actually educational I recommend getting one of those 3D model kits you see in doctors offices in my non-professional opinion.",toys games,puzzles,jigsaw puzzles

They are notorious chewers and before discovering this one, we went through dozens of styles trying to find one that would work for us (including glass). The bottle itself is hard plastic and will crack or shatter if dropped from a height or banged around too much, but it is not fun for him to chew on so that is why we stuck with it. I've only had one (of probably 6 or 7 I've owned) crack, and on this order the first one arrived shattered & was exchanged. The cap part that screws on is a softer plastic, and would be chewed on and ruined if he could get his little teeth anywhere near it, but the metal guard protects it and keeps him from getting to it.",pet supplies,small animals,feeding watering supplies

B000QDTIP4,"Bemka.com Russian Ossetra Crown Farmed Caviar, 2-Ounce Jar",A3F840SQG3W5MW,03-Jun,1,1355356800,"This has to be truly a JOKE. Much like all the other caviar available online/amazon and all over the place. All I'm going to say is this -- caviarastrakhan.com (the website is in English)People, please save your money and don't fall for this scam. Paying this kind of money for farmed (or really any kind) caviar is truly absurd and not fair, not to mention that farmed caviar can't even come close to REAL caviar. So save your money, and read on so you can get yourself some real (and best in the world) caviar for half the price.There is a Russian company called CaviarAstrakhan (caviarastrakhan.com), which as their name suggest is actually located in Astrakhan (this is THE only place in the world where the fish species needed to make Beluga, Osetra and Sevruga caviars exist and reproduce in their natural habitat, they are also found on the IRANIAN side but caviar from IRAN is far worse in quality). Genuine Russian caviar is known to be the best in the world, and Astrakhan caviar is considered THE BEST bar none. That being said, this company sells Astrakhan caviar on their website and ships all over the world, they accept payment in dollars or euros. Generally, Beluga caviar is considered to be the BEST kind, but they feature all 3 (Beluga, Osetra, Sevruga) so you can pick and choose what you like, they have special deals and bundles. As an example to compare to this deal here, you can buy one 4oz jar of Beluga caviar for $98 on caviarastrakhan.com while here you would pay $187 for 2oz of farmed caviar (it makes NO sense). That means you're paying $93 an ounce for this farmed caviar here, that's just a few dollars short of what you'd pay for 4oz of the best caviar in the world!

As cats love novelty and were bored with the single ball that comes in the track, I added 2 balls of the same diameter and differing weights-ours contains the original ball, a golf ball, and a sturdy lightweight plastic ball (clear ones with spinners are great for this). Using 3 balls of differing weights and premium catnip makes Turbo Scratcher irresistible. When kitties paw at any ball in the track, that ball sets the others in motion-which send the others in opposite directions moving at different speeds according to their weights. Action continues for well over a minute-cats stay fascinated and keep playing! Add a couple tablespoons premium catnip at least twice a week-or add a couple teaspoons weekly. My cats have many toys-Turbo Scratcher gets the most use. With frequent use the cardboard insert breaks down over time-I buy the refill packs and replace them once or twice a year. Inserts can be recycled and repurposed-using a bread knife and cutting board, reduce the catnip infused cardboard down to 1.5 inch cubes-insert catnip and cubes deep into missing-mate socks-tie a single knot in the center-voila!

I tried a few other brands that didn't contain aspartame includingGlee Gum Triple Berry, 18-Piece Boxes (Pack of 12)). Between was the best, primarily because the taste lasted and the gum doesn't harden after a few minutes of chewing.

The Bioderma Crealine H20 solution feels like plain water but it takes all makeup off within seconds. If I have false lashes on all I do is apply some to a square cotton pad, press pad on eye for about a minute then just slide the pad down everything comes off without any rubbing or pulling your eye.

Simply wet your nose, apply the strip, wait 15 min then remove. If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless. (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min. I've been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was painful.)The best part is the results. This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use. If you use it regularly after that (such as weekly), you'll see a decrease in the amount of dirt in your pores.It's not often that I stick with a beauty product (lotion, shampoo, hair conditioner, etc.) for years at a time, but this is the one product that I always turn back to for deep cleaning my pores.
